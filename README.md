Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning ABSTRACT Heart plays significant role in living organisms. Diagnosis and prediction of heart related diseases requires more precision, perfection and correctness because a lit- tle mistake can cause fatigue problem or death of the person, there are numerous death cases related to heart and their counting is increasing exponentially day by day. To deal with the problem there is essential need of prediction system for aware- ness about diseases. Machine learning is the branch of Artificial Intelligence(AI), it provides prestigious support in predicting any kind of event which take training from natural events. In this project, Accuracy of machine learning algorithms for predicting heart disease are calculated for this algorithms are k-nearest neighbor, de- cision tree, Logistic Regression and Random Forest by using dataset for training and testing. For implementation of Python programming Anaconda(jupytor) notebook is best tool, which have many type of library, header file, that make the work more accurate and precise.
